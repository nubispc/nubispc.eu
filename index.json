The talk focused on the project’s advancements, particularly the introduction and maturity of the Rust runtimes, alongside the go version of the runtime, and demonstrated how the Kata team is leveraging these technologies to enhance the performance and security of serverless workloads. As a first time Architecture Committee member since April 2024, Dr Nanos presented the current status of the project, and how the team at Nubificus \u0026amp; Nubis is using kata-containers to sandbox serverless workloads, while exposing hardware acceleration capabilities by integrating vAccel to the container runtime.\nKey Highlights of the Presentation Kata Containers Project Overview: Dr Nanos began by providing an overview of the Kata Containers project, an open-source initiative that integrates lightweight virtual machines (VMs) to enhance the security and isolation of containerized applications. He explained how Kata Containers combine the speed and flexibility of containers with the robust security features of VMs, making them an ideal solution for modern cloud-native applications.\nGo and Rust Runtimes: A significant portion of the presentation was dedicated to the dual support for Go and Rust runtimes within Kata Containers. Dr Nanos detailed the journey from the initial Go runtime to the introduction of the Rust runtime, emphasizing the performance and safety benefits of Rust. He discussed the efforts to achieve feature parity between the two runtimes, enabling users to choose the runtime that best suits their needs without sacrificing functionality or performance.\nSandboxing Serverless Workloads: Dr Nanos illustrated how Kata Containers are being used to sandbox serverless workloads, a growing trend in cloud computing. He explained that by using Kata Containers, the team can provide strong isolation for serverless functions, ensuring that workloads are securely sandboxed and isolated from one another. This approach not only enhances security but also improves the reliability and stability of serverless environments.\nvAccel Integration: One of the standout points of the talk was the integration of vAccel with Kata Containers. Dr Nanos explained how vAccel allows the exposure of hardware acceleration functionalities to sandboxed containers, significantly boosting the performance of compute-intensive tasks. This integration enables developers to take full advantage of hardware acceleration within a secure and isolated environment, paving the way for more efficient and powerful applications.\nLooking Ahead: Dr Nanos concluded his presentation with a look ahead to the future of Kata Containers, including the anticipated release of Kata Containers 4.0. He highlighted ongoing efforts to further unify the Go and Rust runtimes and to expand the project’s capabilities to meet the evolving needs of the cloud-native ecosystem.\nThe presentation at OpenInfra days Hungary underscored the Kata Containers project’s commitment to innovation and security in containerized environments. With its robust feature set and continued development, Kata Containers is poised to play a crucial role in the future of cloud-native infrastructure.\nFor more information about the Kata Containers project, visit katacontainers.io.

We presented urunc, a CRI-compatible container runtime spawning unikernels packaged in OCI images. The talk highlighted urunc’s internals, covering hypervisor support, network and storage handling, and integration with high-level orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes, while also addressing network setup implications when combining unikernels and generic containers in a k8s context.\nIn the Microkernel devroom, we continued our exploration of unikernels with a focus on modularity. The team presented bunny, a novel build system aimed at simplifying the Unikernel building process. bunny adopts a layered approach, making use of the modular aspect of Unikernels. Each component represents a distinct layer, eliminating the need for users to manually build dependencies. This approach allows for the creation of minimal and specialized Unikernel images tailored for individual applications.\nThese presentations highlight our commitment to simplify and optimize application delivery in diverse, heterogeneous infrastructure, providing valuable insights into security and system optimization in the evolving landscape of container technology.\nFind below the slides and video recordings of the presentations, along with links to the devrooms full schedule.\nA Modular Approach to Effortless and Dependency-Aware Unikernel Building, Microkernel and Component-based OS devroom session slides video devroom From Containers to Unikernels: Navigating Integration Challenges in Cloud-Native Environments, Containers devroom session slides video devroom FOSDEM\nFOSDEM stands for “Free and Open Source Software Developers’ European Meeting.” It is one of the largest gatherings of open-source developers and enthusiasts in the world.

For a list of the binary components please visit vAccel’s documentation page. The core vAccel library is open-source, available on github.\nvAccel vAccel enables workloads to enjoy hardware acceleration while running on environments that do not have direct (physical) access to acceleration devices. With a slim design and precise abstractions, vAccel semantically exposes hardware acceleration features to users with little to no knoweldge of software acceleration framework internals.\nvAccel integrates with container runtimes such as kata-containers. v0.5.0 brings updated support for kata-containers v3.0, so deploying an application that requires hardware acceleration in a sandboxed container in k8s is now possible without complicated hardware setups!\nA subset of vAccel’s API is also integrated with Unikernel frameworks such as Unikraft. See the relevant documentation for more information on how to get started!\nServerless computing workflows are now able to enjoy compute-offload mechanisms to provide AI/ML services as functions, triggered thousands or millions of times by events, on-demand, auto-scaling to multiple physical and virtual nodes, without the need to directly attach a hardware device to the instance. This functionality is enabled through vAccel’s virtualization backends, enabling the execution of hardware-accelerated functions on Virtual Machines. Support for numerous hypervisors is available, including AWS Firecracker, QEMU/KVM, Cloud Hypervisor, etc. See the relevant documentation on how to run an example on a VM.\nvAccel v0.5.0 offers enhanced API remoting functionality over generic sockets, supporting AF_VSOCK and AF_INET, enabling local (intra-node) and remote execution over the network. Optimized AF_VSOCK support is also offered using the virtio-vsock backend on QEMU/KVM, AWS Firecracker, Cloud hypervisor, Dragonball and any other hypervisor that supports virtio-vsock.\nThis iteration’s update also contains important bug fixes and performance optimizations.\nThe roadmap for v0.6.0 contains PyTorch support (currently under development).\nEnd-users can get a sneak peek at what vAccel has to offer on the project’s website, on github, or by browsing through the available documentation.

These frameworks, commonly used on hardware accelerators, such as TensorRT, Tensorflow, Jetson-inference, or even lower-level abstractions such as CUDA, OpenCL, OpenACC, are now easily usable by the end-user via vAccel. Moreover, vAccel offers a virtualization backend, facilitating the execution of functions on Virtual Machines. Apart from support for AWS Firecracker, QEMU/KVM support is also availabe.\nEnd-users can get a sneak peek at what vAccel on AWS Firecracker has to offer on the project’s website, on github, or on-prem, by using the distributed binaries, or just a container image. To get started, follow one of the tutorials currently available at
