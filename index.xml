      <description>Internship title: Explore TF internal operations to be offloaded to a generic transport mechanism
Short description:
Tensorflow supports offloading computations on hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs). In order to use an accelerator, a Tensorflow instance currently needs direct access to the relevant hardware. Although this requirement doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent distributed deployments (either by Tensorflow itself or by higher level frameworks like pycharm) in heterogeneous hardware, it limits flexibility of integrating hardware accelerators to virtualized setups where Tensorflow applications are executed, especially when there are latency constraints (ie.</description>

      <description>Internship title: BLAS bindings to the vAccel framework
Short description:
The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations.
vAccel is a framework offering hardware acceleration primitives with focus on portability. It exposes &amp;ldquo;accelerate-able&amp;rdquo; functions to programmers and abstracts away hardware complexity by means of a pluggable design.</description>
