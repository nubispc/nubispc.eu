scalable, secure, and efficient device management solutions. Traditional
approaches often struggle with the complexities of managing heterogeneous
fleets of devices while ensuring secure operations and reliable software
delivery. Our Cloud-Native IoT project addresses these challenges by leveraging
k8s to provide a unified, highly automated, and secure ecosystem
tailored for IoT environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of this architecture is &lt;a href="https://docs.akri.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which acts
as the critical bridge between k8s and the diverse array of IoT devices in a
fleet. &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; enables seamless discovery and management of IoT devices,
treating them as integral components of the k8s ecosystem. This integration
eliminates many of the manual steps traditionally required in IoT deployments,
allowing developers to deploy and manage applications across devices with the
same ease as managing containerized workloads in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="understanding-akris-architecture"&gt;Understanding &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;’s Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/akri-logo.png#floatright" alt="" loading="lazy" data-zoomable width="30%" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;’s architecture is designed to extend k8s’ capabilities to IoT devices,
creating a unified interface for managing workloads across cloud, edge, and IoT
layers. It achieves this through three core components: &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; Controllers, &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;
Brokers, and k8s Custom Resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; Controller operates within the k8s control plane, continuously
monitoring for available IoT devices by interacting with various device
plugins. These plugins are responsible for identifying devices such as cameras,
sensors, or other hardware endpoints, which might be connected via USB, network
protocols, or proprietary interfaces. When a device is detected, the &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;
Controller registers it as a k8s resource by creating a corresponding custom
resource (&lt;code&gt;CR&lt;/code&gt;). These &lt;code&gt;CR&lt;/code&gt;s make IoT devices discoverable and manageable using
k8s-native tools, enabling seamless integration with containerized workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure id="figure-figure-1-akris-architecture"&gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/akri-arch.png" alt="Figure 1: `Akri`&amp;#39;s Architecture" loading="lazy" data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Figure 1: &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Architecture
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
Once devices are discovered, &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; Brokers come into play. Brokers are
lightweight, containerized components deployed as k8s pods to manage the
interaction between k8s workloads and the IoT devices they rely on. For
instance, if an application requires access to a specific camera or sensor, the
&lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; Broker ensures the application receives the appropriate connection and
data from the device. Multiple brokers can run simultaneously, each tailored to
specific device types, ensuring scalability and flexibility across diverse
environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;’s architecture enables dynamic device discovery and usage. Whether a
device is added or removed, &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; automatically updates the cluster’s state,
reflecting the current device inventory. This dynamic nature makes it
particularly well-suited for environments where IoT devices may frequently
change, such as smart factories or mobile deployments. By abstracting the
complexities of device management, &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; allows developers to focus on building
and deploying IoT applications rather than wrestling with the nuances of device
connectivity. For more information on our engagement with &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; please have a
look at our &lt;a href="/posts/cloud-native-iot"&gt;previous experiments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="figure-figure-2-akris-steady-state-iot-device-handling"&gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/akri-workflow1.png" alt="Figure 2: `Akri`&amp;#39;s steady state IoT device handling" loading="lazy" data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="beyond-application-management-secure--efficient-ota-updates"&gt;Beyond Application Management: Secure &amp;amp; Efficient &lt;code&gt;OTA&lt;/code&gt; Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; provides a robust foundation for integrating IoT devices with k8s,
our architecture goes further to address critical challenges like simplified
software delivery, trusted execution and secure on-boarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="flashjob-operator--crd"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FlashJob&lt;/code&gt; Operator &amp;amp; CRD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we build a simplified operator and CRD to handle application deployment
on IoT devices. We follow the same principles as &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; (and our previous
attempts), but we decouple the firmware flashing operation from the inventory
setup and discovery of devices: essentially, we let &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; do the heavy lifting
of populating the k8s-related structures with device info, and use this
information to initiate a firmware flash operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator subscribes to &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; instances (the device entries in the k8s
database) and, when needed, is able to retrieve information about each device.
For instance, the operator is able to query the database for the device unique
ID, its network endpoint, firmware version, application type etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="figure-figure-3-flashjob-spawn-and-iot-device-update"&gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/akri-workflow2.png" alt="Figure 3: FlashJob spawn and IoT device update " loading="lazy" data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Figure 3: FlashJob spawn and IoT device update
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a request reaches the operator for a firmware flash on a set of devices,
the operator fetches the relevant information from the database and spawns a
&lt;code&gt;FlashJob&lt;/code&gt; Pod with this information that initiates the &lt;code&gt;OTA&lt;/code&gt; mechanism for the
specific devices. The IoT devices are updated, and, in turn, re-discovered by
the relevant discovery handler of &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;. For instance, if the update refers to
device re-purposing (running a different application than previously), the
relevant discovery handler will detect new devices, whereas the former
discovery handler will update that the old device is not reachable, and it will
be removed from the specific inventory entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate software delivery, the &lt;code&gt;FlashJob&lt;/code&gt; Pod fetches the firmware blob
that will be flashed onto the device from a container registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oci-firmware-packaging"&gt;OCI firmware packaging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firmware blobs are packaged as OCI artifacts, which can be stored in any
OCI-compliant registry. These artifacts are designed to support multiple
devices and configurations, minimizing the burden of managing diverse hardware
across a fleet. The &lt;code&gt;FlashJob&lt;/code&gt; operator that orchestrates updates, fetches only
the relevant parts of the artifact for each device, reducing bandwidth usage
and streamlining the delivery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further optimize the workflow, we build a &lt;a href="https://github.com/nubificus/esp32-build" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;simple
pipeline&lt;/a&gt; that, given the source code
of an application ported to an IoT device framework (such as &lt;code&gt;ESP32&lt;/code&gt;-based
devices, with &lt;code&gt;esp-idf&lt;/code&gt;), builds the binary blob, packages it as an OCI image
and creates an image manifest, annotating each OCI image with the relevant
architecture/platform. These images and manifests are pushed to a generic
container registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;code&gt;FlashJob&lt;/code&gt; side, we use generic tooling and mechanisms to fetch the
relevant firmware blob that matches the device to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zero-touch-and-zero-trust-security-considerations"&gt;Zero-touch and Zero-trust security considerations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating a secure device on-boarding and over-the-air (&lt;code&gt;OTA&lt;/code&gt;) update
framework, ensures that only authenticated devices join the cluster, and that
software updates are delivered optimally, with minimum overhead, without
compromising security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secure on-boarding and &lt;code&gt;OTA&lt;/code&gt; update framework is built on
&lt;a href="https://https://github.com/google/open-dice" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;code&gt;OpenDICE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a lightweight
attestation and identity management solution. This framework leverages
device-specific secrets to derive cryptographic keys, which are used to
generate unique device certificates. These certificates play a pivotal role in
signing &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-eat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;code&gt;EAT&lt;/code&gt; (Entity Attestation
Tokens)&lt;/a&gt;, embedding
critical device metadata such as the application type, firmware version, and
other relevant attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devices send these signed EATs to key system components, such as the discovery
handler, enabling robust device attestation. This process verifies device
authenticity and enforces strict access control policies, ensuring that only
authorized devices can communicate and interact within the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="figure-figure-4-iot-device-ota-update-workflow"&gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/iot-dice-workflow.png" alt="Figure 4: IoT device `OTA` update workflow" loading="lazy" data-zoomable width="60%" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Figure 4: IoT device &lt;code&gt;OTA&lt;/code&gt; update workflow
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;OTA&lt;/code&gt; updates, the framework issues updates exclusively to trusted platform
components, maintaining integrity and security throughout the update process.
When paired with a secure boot mechanism, the framework ensures that devices
start in a trusted state immediately upon powering on. Together, these features
establish a strong foundation for trust, security, and reliability across the
entire lifecycle of the device—from initialization to operational updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="use-cases"&gt;Use Cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Cloud-Native IoT framework has applications in a wide range of industries,
each with unique requirements that benefit from the architecture’s flexibility,
security, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In manufacturing, smart factories can leverage this architecture to manage
fleets of sensors, robotic arms, and edge devices. With &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;’s dynamic device
discovery and k8s’ orchestration capabilities, factories can deploy multi-tier
applications that span cloud-based analytics, edge-based processing, and
IoT-based data collection. Secure on-boarding and trusted &lt;code&gt;OTA&lt;/code&gt; updates ensure
that only authorized devices operate in these environments, minimizing risks
associated with counterfeit hardware or outdated firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthcare, where compliance and data integrity are critical, our framework
enables secure deployment and management of medical IoT devices, such as
patient monitors or diagnostic equipment. By packaging software updates as OCI
artifacts, healthcare providers can ensure consistency across devices while
adhering to strict regulatory standards. &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;’s ability to dynamically discover
and manage devices also simplifies the deployment of new technologies in
hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retail industry can benefit from deploying smart shelves, cameras, and
IoT-enabled inventory systems using this architecture. The ability to deliver
targeted &lt;code&gt;OTA&lt;/code&gt; updates based on device-specific requirements ensures that
software upgrades don’t disrupt operations, even during peak business hours.
Additionally, secure on-boarding mechanisms guarantee that only authorized
devices interact with sensitive business systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to traditional IoT applications, device re-purposing opens new
opportunities for innovation by enabling the same hardware to perform entirely
different functions depending on operational needs. For example, devices
running &lt;code&gt;tinyML&lt;/code&gt; applications, can be dynamically re-purposed to execute a
different model, or even application, bringing flexible and adaptable machine
learning inference at the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a smart camera in a retail environment, deployed for security
purposes &amp;ndash; the same device can be repurposed to run a &lt;code&gt;tinyML&lt;/code&gt;-powered model for
customer analytics, such as tracking foot traffic or identifying
high-engagement areas within a store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In agriculture, an IoT sensor initially configured to monitor soil moisture
could be repurposed to run a &lt;code&gt;tinyML&lt;/code&gt; model detecting crop diseases based on
image data captured by an attached camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in industrial settings, robotic arms used for assembly line tasks
can be reprogrammed to perform quality assurance using &lt;code&gt;tinyML&lt;/code&gt; models for
anomaly detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flexibility eliminates downtime and minimizes costs associated with
dedicated hardware for each task. Re-purposing is not only secure and
efficient, but also highly adaptable, enabling a single fleet of devices to
cater to multiple use cases across industries. Users can easily transition
devices to support various &lt;code&gt;tinyML&lt;/code&gt; workloads or other specialized applications
as required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining k8s with IoT-specific innovations, our Cloud-Native IoT project
provides a scalable, secure, and efficient solution for managing IoT devices.
&lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;’s architecture brings dynamic device discovery and integration into the
k8s ecosystem, while the secure on-boarding and &lt;code&gt;OTA&lt;/code&gt; update framework ensures
that devices operate reliably and securely throughout their lifecycle. The
OCI-compliant process of packaging the firmware blob facilitates the
cloud-native integration of IoT device re-purposing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach empowers end-users to deploy complex applications across cloud,
edge, and IoT layers with ease, opening up new possibilities for automation,
intelligence, and operational efficiency. As IoT continues to reshape
industries, adopting a cloud-native framework will be essential for staying
ahead in this rapidly evolving space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned as we push the boundaries of what’s possible with Cloud-native IoT!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud-native IoT deployments with Akri</title><link>/blog/cloud-native-iot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 14:28:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/cloud-native-iot/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand, managing a large number of
heterogeneous devices with diverse requirements and characteristics has become
essential. The Cloud computing ecosystem has provided a vast amount of tools to
efficiently manage workload deployments. However, there is a huge gap between
the requirements of Cloud infrastructure as opposed to Edge or IoT
infrastructure. One crucial difference is the diversity and resource
constraints of IoT devices. As billions of devices become part of our
environment, the need for secure, robust device management and seamless
integration into higher-level orchestration frameworks becomes increasingly
critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes (K8s) has emerged as the standard for container orchestration but
dealing with resource-constrained edge devices poses significant challenges.
This blog post explores the challenges and proposed solutions for managing IoT
device firmware in the context of cloud-native orchestration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="challenges-in-iot-device-management"&gt;Challenges in IoT Device Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing IoT devices presents unique challenges due to the diversity of IoT
ecosystems, the scale of deployments, and the necessity for secure and
efficient operations. These challenges are categorized into three main areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firmware Management&lt;/em&gt;: Ensuring that all IoT devices are running the latest
firmware versions securely and efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orchestration&lt;/em&gt;: Integrating IoT devices into existing orchestration
frameworks without overburdening their limited resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security and On-boarding&lt;/em&gt;: Securely on-boarding new devices and managing the
security of existing devices throughout their lifecycle .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-cloud-native-ecosystem"&gt;The Cloud-native Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud-native concept has revolutionized the design, development,
deployment, and management of applications by leveraging cloud computing
principles such as scalability, resilience, automation, and agility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containerization and micro-services are essential to this approach, providing
flexibility, efficient resource utilization, and consistency across diverse
environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, deploying containers on IoT devices is not entirely feasible, due to
their limited processing power, memory, and storage. To address these
constraints, the community has proposed alternative solutions, including
cloud-native management frameworks running as micro-services on edge devices
close to the IoT infrastructure. These edge devices act as proxies or gateways,
facilitating communication with the IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iot-device-management-frameworks"&gt;IoT Device Management Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two popular cloud-native management frameworks for Edge/IoT devices are
&lt;a href="https://kubeedge.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;code&gt;KubeEdge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.akri.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These
frameworks integrate with the cloud-native ecosystem, offering various benefits
and facing certain limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/kube-edge-logo.webp#floatleft" alt="" loading="lazy" data-zoomable width="12%" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;KubeEdge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: Extends Kubernetes to the edge, providing infrastructure support
for edge computing applications. It enables centralized management of edge
nodes and devices, offering features like device management, data
synchronization, and edge application deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/akri-logo.png#floatright" alt="" loading="lazy" data-zoomable width="25%" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: Focuses on edge device discovery and management, simplifying the
integration of IoT devices into Kubernetes clusters. &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; automatically
detects and registers IoT devices, making them available to applications
running in the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the above frameworks, however, provide a pure cloud-native approach to
firmware updating. Specifically, both use custom containers that can fetch the
firmware from specific locations available either locally or publicly, and
use custom tools to flash the firmware directly to the device. This means that
none of these frameworks take advantage of the unique characteristics of the
OCI spec to leverage software delivery benefits seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="enhancements-to-akri"&gt;Enhancements to &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we shared our take on how to tackle these challenges in a
&lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3642975.3678967" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt; presented at
the &lt;a href="https://meccworkshop.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;code&gt;MECC&lt;/code&gt; workshop&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://2024.eurosys.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;code&gt;EuroSys&lt;/code&gt;
2024&lt;/a&gt;. In this work, we introduce enhancements to
the &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; framework to reduce resource utilization on edge gateways, moving
towards a fully unified infrastructure management solution based on
cloud-native concepts. These enhancements aim to simplify IoT device firmware
management and improve the efficiency of IoT device firmware upgrades across
the Cloud-Edge-IoT continuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="figure-figure-1-stock-akri-workflow"&gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/akri-workflow.png" alt="Figure 1: Stock `Akri` workflow" loading="lazy" data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Figure 1: Stock &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; workflow
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; is a fully-featured, modular framework to &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; IoT device
&lt;em&gt;applications&lt;/em&gt;. When it comes to firmware flashing (e.g. &lt;code&gt;OTA&lt;/code&gt; updates), &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;
relies on the user to provide a custom container image that is responsible for
fetching the firmware, communicating with the device and eventually flashing
the firmware on the device. Our approach is to leverage &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; for the device
identification and mapping, while at the same time add the functionality to
define which devices we would like to upgrade / re-purpose. A proof of concept
has been implemented and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/project-akri/akri/compare/main...nubificus:akri:akri-nubis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;code
changes&lt;/a&gt;
are minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, we add an extra type of job in the &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; Controller logic.
Initially, the &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; Configuration must include additional values such as the
&lt;code&gt;FirmwareJobSpec&lt;/code&gt;, responsible for managing the firmware of the leaf device.
Additionally, the internal structures holding the fields of the Configuration
&lt;code&gt;CRD&lt;/code&gt; need to be expanded. More importantly, the Controller needs another piece
of logic to check whether there is a &lt;code&gt;firmwareJobSpec&lt;/code&gt; field in the
configuration, and if positive, deploy the firmware jobs accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="figure-figure-2-updated-akri-workflow"&gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/akri-workflow-updated.png" alt="Figure 2: Updated `Akri` workflow" loading="lazy" data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Figure 2: Updated &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; workflow
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference in terms of action compared to vanilla &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; is
the scheduling of the &lt;code&gt;firmwareJob&lt;/code&gt;, which is handled by the Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more detail, the &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt; Configuration &lt;code&gt;CRD&lt;/code&gt; needs additional fields to hold the
values of &lt;code&gt;firmwareJob&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# deployment/helm/crds/akri-configuration-crd.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The logic to handle the extra configuration field resides in &lt;a href="https://github.com/nubificus/akri/blob/215c44530e5b839231b19c331a9c953e6a1eab13/controller/src/util/instance_action.rs#L447" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;code&gt;controller/src/util/instance_action.rs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;controller/src/util/instance_action.rs
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; if let Some(firmweare_job_spec) = &amp;amp;configuration.spec.firmware_job_spec {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; trace!(&amp;#34;about to handle the firmware job spec {:?}&amp;#34;, firmweare_job_spec);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; let firmware_change_result = handle_instance_change_job(
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; instance,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; *configuration.metadata.generation.as_ref().unwrap(),
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;amp;firmweare_job_spec,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; action,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; kube_interface,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; ).await;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially this part checks if &lt;code&gt;firmwareJobSpec&lt;/code&gt; exists in the configuration
given and then calls &lt;code&gt;handle_instance_job&lt;/code&gt; a function responsible for handling
k8s Jobs in &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A firmware flash can be triggered by applying a new Configuration or updating
an existing one. When we apply a new configuration the discovery handler is
spawned and is responsible for finding devices attached to nodes (virtually or
physically). When the detection is over, it&amp;rsquo;s time for the &lt;code&gt;brokerPods&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;firmwareJobs&lt;/code&gt; to be deployed. The &lt;code&gt;brokerPod&lt;/code&gt; holds the load / application
utilizing the device. The &lt;code&gt;firmwareJob&lt;/code&gt; is responsible for checking the
firmware version, of the device and if a newer version is specified then the
firmware update is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When updating a configuration the old one is deleted along with the linked
instances and &lt;code&gt;brokerPods&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;firmwareJobs&lt;/code&gt; and a new set of Configuration
with the additional pods or &lt;code&gt;firmwareJobs&lt;/code&gt; are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we add a new device type, if the device is discoverable from the discovery
handler, &lt;code&gt;brokerPods&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;brokerJobs&lt;/code&gt; will be deployed utilizing the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently working on a refactor of our approach and we will provide an
update once we have something concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the management of IoT devices within a cloud-native ecosystem is
crucial for leveraging the full potential of IoT technology. By addressing the
challenges posed by resource constraints at the edge and proposing enhancements
to existing frameworks like &lt;code&gt;Akri&lt;/code&gt;, this work contributes to more accessible and
efficient orchestration solutions for IoT environments. Future efforts will
focus on further refining these solutions and integrating them into mainstream
IoT management practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging cloud-native principles and addressing the unique challenges of
IoT device management, we can create a more cohesive and efficient continuum
for the deployment and management of applications in IoT environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for updates on this front!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Navigating ESP32 wireless connectivity issues</title><link>/blog/esp32_wifi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 09:31:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/esp32_wifi/</guid><description>
&lt;figure &gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/wifi-logo.png#floatleft" alt="" loading="lazy" data-zoomable width="30%" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourselves scratching your heads over perplexing connectivity issues? If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like us, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably encountered your fair share of head-scratching moments. In this short post, we would like to share one such experience we recently tackled while trying to connect our &lt;code&gt;ESP32&lt;/code&gt; devices to our office &lt;code&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/code&gt; Access Point (AP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/esp32.png#floatright" alt="" loading="lazy" data-zoomable width="30%" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge emerged when we needed to integrate &lt;code&gt;ESP32&lt;/code&gt; devices into our existing infrastructure, a set of &lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;aarch64&lt;/code&gt; nodes, interconnected into a number of clusters where we experiment and deploy the systems software we build. The catch? The data room lacked &lt;code&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/code&gt; coverage, except for the AP of the upstream modems, leaving our IoT devices isolated from the clusters&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;VLAN&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, we had two options: either invest in a new AP, dedicated to the IoT devices in the data room or use one of the cluster nodes to act as an AP, bridging their ethernet connectivity with their &lt;code&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/code&gt; interfaces. Opting for the latter, we started working on setting up the AP on a &lt;code&gt;RPi&lt;/code&gt; device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
&lt;div class="w-100" &gt;&lt;img src="/images/images/rpi.png#floatleft" alt="" loading="lazy" data-zoomable width="20%" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;code&gt;Raspbian&lt;/code&gt; uses Network Manager to handle all network connections. Using &lt;code&gt;nmtui&lt;/code&gt; on stock &lt;code&gt;Raspbian&lt;/code&gt;, we set up a bridge between &lt;code&gt;eth0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wlan0&lt;/code&gt;, configure the &lt;code&gt;SSID&lt;/code&gt;, and set the &lt;code&gt;WPA-PSK&lt;/code&gt; password for the AP. After playing around with &lt;code&gt;nmtui&lt;/code&gt;, we figured that it might be easier to setup the AP using the command line tool, &lt;code&gt;nmcli&lt;/code&gt;. A snippet like the following would do the trick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-console" data-lang="console"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;nmcli c add type wifi ifname wlan0 con-name WIFI_AP autoconnect yes ssid nbfc-iot
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;nmcli con modify WIFI_AP 802-11-wireless.mode ap 802-11-wireless.band bg ipv4.method shared
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;nmcli con modify WIFI_AP wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;nmcli con modify WIFI_AP wifi-sec.psk &amp;#34;PASSWORD&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;nmcli con up WIFI_AP
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial tests with a mobile phone and a laptop connecting to the AP were successful, but when it came to connecting the &lt;code&gt;ESP32&lt;/code&gt; devices, we hit a roadblock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;code&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/code&gt; scans showing the correct &lt;code&gt;SSID&lt;/code&gt;s, the &lt;code&gt;ESP32&lt;/code&gt; devices stubbornly refused to connect. We tried everything: from tinkering with frequency bands (5GHz/2.4GHz) to flashing one of the devices with &lt;code&gt;micropython&lt;/code&gt; and experimenting with network and &lt;code&gt;WLAN&lt;/code&gt; connectivity settings &amp;ndash; all to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While debugging the issue, we listed available &lt;code&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/code&gt; networks from a neighboring &lt;code&gt;RPi&lt;/code&gt; node, and from the ESP32 device that we flashed with &lt;code&gt;micropython&lt;/code&gt;. The output from the &lt;code&gt;RPi&lt;/code&gt; device and the ESP32 device is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NBFC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;WPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WPA2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PSK&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RSSI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BSSID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By examining the output, we finally pinpointed the culprit: the &lt;code&gt;ESP32&lt;/code&gt; devices only support &lt;code&gt;WPA2&lt;/code&gt;, whereas our &lt;code&gt;RPi&lt;/code&gt; AP defaulted to plain &lt;code&gt;WPA&lt;/code&gt;. The solution? Modify the &lt;code&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/code&gt; security protocol setting on the &lt;code&gt;RPi&lt;/code&gt;s to use &lt;code&gt;WPA2&lt;/code&gt;. Finding a way to do this was much more complicated than it should. Luckily, we were able to find our way around &lt;code&gt;nmcli&lt;/code&gt; and setup &lt;code&gt;RSN&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;WPA2&lt;/code&gt;) using the &lt;code&gt;nmcli&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-console" data-lang="console"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;nmcli con modify WIFI_AP 802-11-wireless-security.proto rsn
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;WIFI_AP&lt;/code&gt; is the names of the connection. A command that proved particularly useful was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-console" data-lang="console"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; nmcli con show WIFI_AP
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;[snipped]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;802-11-wireless.ssid: nbfc-iot
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;802-11-wireless.mode: ap

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;giving us all the configuration parameters for &lt;code&gt;nmcli&lt;/code&gt; and this particular connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this seemingly small adjustment, the &lt;code&gt;ESP32&lt;/code&gt; devices connected to our office networks, and our cloud-native exploration for &lt;code&gt;IoT&lt;/code&gt; devices could proceed without further hiccup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this experience, we&amp;rsquo;re reminded of the importance of thorough testing and persistence when dealing with diverse hardware and complex network setups. Sometimes, the solution lies in seemingly small configuration tweaks that make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope sharing this journey proves helpful to others facing similar challenges in their &lt;code&gt;IoT&lt;/code&gt; projects. Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
